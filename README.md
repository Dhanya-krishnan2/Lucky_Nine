John's first commit


///////  Press Release  /////////

Sam from Subiaco wanted to determine if he had contracted covid-19. He liked the Australian Governments Covid-19 App. However he wants a website where he could submit information on his current condition and the app could suggest whether or not he had the virus. If the website said he was at risk he also wants the ability to check where the nearest doctor is.
